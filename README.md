**S-LDM** (Server Local Dynamic Map) C/C++ implementation in the context of the 5G-CARMEN project.

This repository is the main repository for the CNIT S-LDM implementation, and it is set to be **private**, for the time being.

The repository should contain all the source, header and library files to build all the instances of the S-LDM for the project use cases and for internal testing.

The repository contains the following folders:
- `docs`, for images and documentation
- `examples`, for any example useful to the development of the S-LDM
- `include`, for all the header files
- `src`, for all the .c and .cpp/.cc source files
- `tester`, for a tester module, to be used in conjunction with [ms-van3t](https://github.com/marcomali/ms-van3t), with the aim of testing the S-LDM in the lab with emulated vehicles
